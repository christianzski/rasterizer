# Rasterization
A multithreaded C++ CPU rasterizer to rasterize triangles directly onto a Linux framebuffer. This is built as for educational purposes; not intended to be run for anything real.

While most of our graphical work depends on rasterization, it seems to be becoming a lost art where many of us aren't aware how it is done. Developing an understanding of rasterization gives us a deeper appreciation and understanding of our graphics pipelines.
